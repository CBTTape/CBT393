//***FILE 393 from Robert Lamerand and Ken MacKenzie, and contains  *   FILE 393
//*           a handy REXX exec to tell you what RACF groups you    *   FILE 393
//*           are connected to.  The following are some notes from  *   FILE 393
//*           both contributors:                                    *   FILE 393
//*                                                                 *   FILE 393
//*     I think the original author is Bob Lamerand.  The note is   *   FILE 393
//*     from Ken MacKenzie:                                         *   FILE 393
//*                                                                 *   FILE 393
//*     Here's a simple REXX exec that allows a user to see         *   FILE 393
//*     what groups he is connected to.  We run with                *   FILE 393
//*     "list-of-groups" active.  I'm not sure what this will       *   FILE 393
//*     report on a system if it is inactive.                       *   FILE 393
//*                                                                 *   FILE 393
//*     Subject: RACF Group Enquiry                                 *   FILE 393
//*                                                                 *   FILE 393
//*     I was sent the following REXX exec the other day.  I        *   FILE 393
//*     made a slight modification from the original (to pick       *   FILE 393
//*     up the correct area length).  The exec lists the groups     *   FILE 393
//*     that a user belongs to or returns YES or NO to indicate     *   FILE 393
//*     that he belongs to a specific group.                        *   FILE 393
//*                                                                 *   FILE 393
//*     The exec works fine but, on browsing the RACF               *   FILE 393
//*     documentation, I get the impression that the list of        *   FILE 393
//*     groups will not be updated should the user be added to      *   FILE 393
//*     a new group.                                                *   FILE 393
//*                                                                 *   FILE 393
//*     Can anyone confirm that this is true?  And, if so, can      *   FILE 393
//*     anyone suggest a way of having the group list updated       *   FILE 393
//*     (without logging off then logging on)?                      *   FILE 393
//*                                                                 *   FILE 393
//*     Thanks-in-advance,                                          *   FILE 393
//*                                                                 *   FILE 393
